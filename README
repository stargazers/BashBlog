BashBlog
=========

	About
	======

		BashBlog is very simple blog generator written with bash.

		It does not use any kind of database engines, only plain
		text files. It does generate sub pages when you just create them
		and add blogtitle.txt file inside that folder. All text files (except
		that blogtitle.txt) will be listed in that sub page as a blog text.

		BashBlog does not have any kind of web UI because it is meant
		to use with just any text editor. So, there is no any kind of
		admin panels and that kind of bells and whistles. You just login
		to your shell, go to correct directory, open your editor of choice
		and create a new textfile with correct filename. Then you just write
		it and save it an it will appear on your site. Easy, huh?

		You can sort easily your subpages in order you want just renaming
		those folders. Eg. 01-main, 05-someother, 10-thirdpage.
		If you just want to change 05-someother page to the right side of
		a 10-thirdpage, you just mv 05-someother to 15-thirdpage or
		whatever way you prefer - pages are added in alphabetical order.

		Files (eg. blog texts) are sorted in reverse order, so the newest
		blogtexts will be shown first.

		Subpage creating is also made easily - all folders what have a
		file blogtitle.txt file will be shown in top menu as a subpage.
		That should be easy enough, right?

	Installation
	=============

		Copy source codes of BashBlog + CSS-file in somewhere where your
		web server can run .cgi files. Then create main folder and create
		a blogtitle.txt under it.

			cd path/where/server/can/use/bashblog
			mkdir 01-main
			echo "My superious blog" > 01-main/blogtitle.txt

		If you want to change HTML page title, then you create blogtitle.txt
		also in your BashBlog path and just type whatever you wish your
		HTML page title should be.

		Then when you have 01-main folder, just create new blog text
		like this way (I prefer VIM, change to whatever you like).

			vim 01-main/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S).txt

		Then just write your blog entry. First line is the blogtext
		"topic line", second line is empty and then just just write
		your blogtext. And yeah, surely you can use html codes inside it.

		After you have written your blogtext, just quit your editor
		of choice and refresh your page in browser and you should see
		your just written blog text on your page.

		TIP: It will be much easier to create some script what will 
		     automatially do that $(date) stuff for you. 
			 For example create file blog_new and give it permissions
			 to run (chmod +x). Then in that blog_new you just call
			 VIM or whatever with correct filename. After you have made
			 sure that your blog_new script is in path what can be found
			 on enviroment variable $PATH, then you just go to correct dir,
			 for example 01-main and type blog_new and enter. Then you cannot
			 make wrong filename accidentally.
